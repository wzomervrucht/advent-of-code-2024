These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). The solutions are written in [TypeScript 5.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [tsx](https://tsx.is/) on [Node.js 22.11](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage

```
npx tsx solve.ts
```

The command accepts these options:

- `-d`, `--day`: only run the selected day,
- `-p`, `--part`: only run the selected puzzle part,
- `-i`, `--input`: use the given input file.

If no input file is specified on the command line, the program uses `input.txt` in the matching puzzle folder (not included in the repository).

## Tests

The examples from the puzzle descriptions are included as test cases. To run the tests:

```
npx tsx --test
```
